## 🧩 The Foundation (About Me)
I am a Computer Science student at the **Department of Computer Science (UBIT), University of Karachi**. My approach to tech is built on a "Paper-First" philosophy—I believe sketching the logic flow is the most critical step in engineering. Currently focusing on **Data Science** to bridge the gap between complex algorithms and real-world impact.

* 🔭 **Current Goal:** Mastering predictive modeling and high-level data visualization.
* 🧠 **Strengths:** Algorithmic thinking, clean code architecture, and analytical storytelling.
* 🏫 **Base:** UBIT, University of Karachi.

## 🚀 Impact Projects (How I Build)

### 📊 Burnout Analytics Engine
*Solving the productivity puzzle through data.*
* **Concept:** This project was built using **Statistical Analysis** and **Data Visualization** concepts. 
* **Execution:** Used `Pandas` for cleaning behavioral datasets, `NumPy` for numerical processing, and `Matplotlib` to visualize the correlation between workload and mental fatigue.
* **Why it matters:** It demonstrates how data can be used to solve human-centric problems like burnout.

### 🔢 Modular Counter System
*Engineering scalability through OOP.*
* **Concept:** Focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles like Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Inheritance.
* **Execution:** Developed using `Python Classes`. Instead of a static counter, I built a modular system that can handle multiple independent instances, showcasing clean memory management and logical flow.
* **Why it matters:** It proves that even simple tools can be engineered with professional-grade architecture.
